Ah, who might you be?
Castor? Castor the inventor? Well, it is nice to make your acquaintance.
While I would love to tell you my name, I cannot. All I can tell you is my friends call me Half Light.
I am here on a mission to get intel. Something very important.
In one of these cells is a journal, Death Clutch's journal.
It is hidden underneath his mattress, but I don't know which cell was his.
Find his cell, retrieve the journal, and deliver it to me.
If you don't want to help me that is fine, just make sure you take down Death Clutch.
