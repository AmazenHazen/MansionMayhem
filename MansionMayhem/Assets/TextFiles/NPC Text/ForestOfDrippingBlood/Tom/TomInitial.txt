Thank god you are here! I need some help.
What is that? My daughter sent you to check on me?
Well, here I am, trapped as a ghost.
I need your help. I cannot return back to the realm of the living.
I can help you defeat the ancient evil that lurks in this forest.
Are you up for the task?

Great. I must first tell you how I got like this.
While at the cabin I decided to go hunt during the Blood Moon.
During the Blood Moon, everything belongs to its master:
The Beast of Dripping Blood.
Every animal is its property at night.
I hunted a deer and violated his property.
The Beast of Dripping Blood could smell the blood spilled and appeared to me.
He was huge! His body was made of blood and he had a mane of a thousand leeches.
He told me that a sacrifice was required to replace what I had stolen.
He seperated my body from my soul, consumed my body, and tethered my soul to this plane.
The only way to break it is to perform a sacrificial ritual to replace what is owed.
A life for a life.
North of here is a cave with three offering stones.
This is what you need for the offering stones and the ritual:
The teeth of an ancient blood sucking fish, the sap of the bleeding Black Blood tree, and a living animal sacrifice.
Use what you can find around the cabin and the shed to get these.
Then perform the ritual in the cave to the north.
That should be enough to free me.
