You can identify enemies by the health bar above their head.
Each enemy behaves differently, so be careful.
Colliding with any enemy or enemy projectile will damage the player.
Using the left mouse button you can shoot your own projectiles.
If you want to switch your weapon, just press the Q key (other weapons must be equiped).
To use a Trinket's ability use the E Key (A trinket must be equipped).
To run, hit the shift button! But you must have stamina!
