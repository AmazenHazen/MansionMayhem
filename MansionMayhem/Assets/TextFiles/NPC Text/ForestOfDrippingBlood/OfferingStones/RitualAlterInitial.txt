You read the latin writing from the book on the stone alter.
The lettering in the book shines with a bright red light.
You freeze in place.
You feel your blood stop circulating.
Your heart speeds up and skips a few beats.
Blood gushes out from the lettering of the book causing the alter to be covered with blood.
Everything becomes hot and you can feel yourself sweat.
You try to breathe but you can't seem to get a gasp of air.
Then everything stops.
In front of you rises huge humanoid made of blood.
It has the teeth of the lamprey, a body of blood like the bleeding tree, and large veins coming off of its back.

The blood-like humanoid opens it's mouth and speaks.
"The proxy ritual has been completed? I cannot believe that a human has brought me back into this realm. Who dares summon me?"

"Remaining silent I see, well I hope you will have more to say then just that in front of my Proxy."
"It really doesn't matter who you are. You have helped awaken me."
"Even though I awaken I can feel that I am still chained to the Dark Elemental..."
"Why have you awakened me?..."
"You want to free a man's soul from my control? I guess I can do that since you summoned me."
The proxy snaps his fingers and you can tell a soul has been freed from this realm.
"It is done."
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
The blood proxy in front of you starts to melt.
"What have you done...No! You have sacrificed one of my own creatures to create this Proxy!"
"You created an unstable Proxy. You will regret what you have done here! Face my Proxy in his full power!"
The Proxy breaks the stone table into smitherines and lunges at you.
