The four Temperaments

Blood

From birth I circulate
I deliver necessary substances through your body
I am the Sanguine Temperament
Enthusiastic and Active
Infecting me causes disease
Without me you die



Wax (yellow bile)

In childhood I protect your senses
I protect your airways and prevent infection
I am the Choleric Temperament
Independence and Decisive
Infecting me causes imbalance
Without me you lose your sense




Oil (black bile)

Through your adulthood I cause you to smell
I protect your skin from the outside elements
I am the Melancholic Temperament
Detailed and Profound
Infecting me causes acne
Without me you burn from the inside




Phlegm (Mucus)

In old age I prevent sickness
I protect your airways and prevent diseases
I am the Phlegmatic Temperament
Relaxed and Peaceful
Infecting me causes suffocation
Without me you suffocate
