You stuff the steak in your inventory with the sleeping pill you found and set up the cage to trap an animal.
You hide in the bushes and wait for an animal to fall for the trap.
You see this crazy looking blood red spiked creature head towards the cave.
You see tenticles expel from its mouth to drain the blood of the steak.
After draining all of the steaks blood it goes in and devours the steak.
It immediately falls asleep.
I wonder what would happen if you sacrificed this creature of dripping blood instead of a normal animal.
You put the ferocious blood sucking beast in your bag.
