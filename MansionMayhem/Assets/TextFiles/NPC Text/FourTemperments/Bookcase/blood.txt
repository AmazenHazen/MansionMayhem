"The Blood Moon beckens the beast of dripping blood."
"Every single drop of blood belongs to him."
"He sees into your life force."
"Dreor stirs!"

You freeze in place.
You feel your blood stop circulating.
Your heart clenches as it skips a few beats.
You close the book and blood gushes out from the edges of the book.
Everything becomes cold and you see your breath.
You try to scream but you hear nothing.
Then everything returns to normal.
You look down expecting to see a pool of blood on the ground.
But there isn't a single drop.
You feel as though you now know of an ancient evil you didn't yet know.
