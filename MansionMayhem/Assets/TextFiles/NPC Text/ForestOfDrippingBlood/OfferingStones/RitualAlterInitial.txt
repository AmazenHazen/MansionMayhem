You don't have everything placed on the offering stone for the ritual of dripping blood.
I would check the offering stones to check which parts of the ritual you still need.

You read the latin writing from the book on the stone alter.
The lettering in the book shines with a bright red light.
You freeze in place.
You feel your blood stop circulating.
Your heart clenches as it skips a few beats.
Blood gushes out from the lettering of the book causing the alter to be covered with blood.
The teeth from the Lamprey float and fly in front of the alter.
The blood sap from the bleeding tree bubbles over and moves along the ground to in front of the alter.
The beast wakes up in what seems to be a trance and walks over to the ground in the frotn of the alter.
Everything becomes hot and you can feel yourself sweat.
You try to breathe but you can't seem to get a gasp of fresh air.
Then everything stops.
In front of you is a huge humanoid made of blood.
It has the teeth of the Lamprey, a body of blood from the bleeding tree, and vein tentacles coming off its back fo the beast.
The blood-like humanoid opens it's mouth to speak.

"The proxy ritual has been completed? I cannot believe that a human has brought me back into this realm. Who dares summon me?"

"Remaining silent I see, well I hope you will have more to say then just that in front of my Proxy."
"It really doesn't matter who you are. You have helped awaken me."
"Even though I awaken I can feel that I am still chained to the Dark Elemental..."
"Why have you awakened me?"
"You want to free a man's soul from my control? I guess I can do that since you summoned me. I will let it be done."
The proxy snaps his fingers and you can tell a soul has been freed from this realm.
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
You notice that the humanoid creature starts to look like it is melting.
"What have you done...No! You have sacrificed one of my own creatures to create this Proxy!"
"You fiend, as long as this Proxy stands I will "
