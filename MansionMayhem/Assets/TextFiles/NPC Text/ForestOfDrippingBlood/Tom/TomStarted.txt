Do you have what you need?
Remember, this is what you need:
The teeth of an ancient blood sucking fish,
The sap of the bleeding Black Blood tree,
And a live animal sacrifice.
Use what you can find around the cabin and the shed to get these.
Then perform the ritual in the cave to the north.
That should be enough to free me.
