Wow, that's a super cool invention! A laser gun!
(To shoot lasers from it you will have to press the left mouse.)
I can't wait to see the next blueprints you come up with Castor.
I'm sure that in the future there will be other cool weapons to invent!
(If you have more than one weapon you can switch between weapons using the "Q" key.)
Even though you have your cool new laser weapon, you should practice your marksmanship.
Go to the testing room to the north and use the terminal.
It will activate some of those old robots that have been lying around for awhile.
When you have defeated all of them return back to me.
