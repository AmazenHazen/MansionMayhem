You haven't restored the Ritual Circle yet.
The Demon Circle is north of me.
What you need to collect is a vial of blood, a black twisted demon horn, and the demonic tome.
Good luck on finding them!

Thank you! I can finally return to the Demon Realm.
I will forever be thankful. Maybe I can help you one day.
