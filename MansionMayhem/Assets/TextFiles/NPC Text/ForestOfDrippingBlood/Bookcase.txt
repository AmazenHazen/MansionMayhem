You look in the bookcase and find a "Fishing Encyclopedia for Dummies".
You flip to the first page.

"Be careful when detaching a leech if it latches onto you."
"Angler Fish: This uncommon fish has a fiend-like appearance and uses the light on its head to attract other fish to eat."

Interesting selection of fish for the first four pages. You close the book and put it back on the shelf
