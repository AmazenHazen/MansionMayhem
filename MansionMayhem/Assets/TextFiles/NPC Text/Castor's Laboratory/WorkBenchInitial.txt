While in the "Workbench" Menu you can spend the screws you own to create cool inventions.
There are three types of inventions you can create: Character, Weapons, and Trinkets.
Character inventions improve aspects of Castor such as increasing stanima, health, or being able to collect screws from a distance.
Weapon inventions unlock the ability to use new weapons or improve already unlocked weapons. Each weapon behaves differently so choose what you want to invent wisely.
Trinket inventions are inventions that are special in nature and can do anything! Some will come in handy against certain enemies.
Also, it is important to note that Castor can only carry three weapons and one trinket when going on a Paranormal Hunt.
You can change what Castor has equipped through the "Loadout" Menu on the level select screen.
To use more screws and to create more inventions in the future, access "Workbench" Menu in the level select screen.
