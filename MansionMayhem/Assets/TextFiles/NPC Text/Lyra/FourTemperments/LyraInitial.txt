Ah, who might you be?
Castor? Ah you are the supernatural hunter inventor I have been hearing a lot about! I was wondering if I'd ever bump into you!
I'm Lyra, a young biochemist! Don't let my age fool you though, I'm an expert in researching supernatural biomaterials.
All my life I have wondered, how is ectoplasm created? What supernatural process allows the secretion of that material.
Nuggets! I'm getting off track like I always do!
I got here shortly before you and discovered that there are unceasing secreting monsters in this chateau.
Through what I have gathered they are monsters of human secretion, but to a monstrous degree.
Oil, Mucus, Wax, and Blood.
Anyways, I was searching around and was able to find texts about these monsters!
But before I was able to snag a look, I was chased out by a funky gunky monster.
It would be coolest if you were to find all the texts for the four types of secretionous monsters, I'll reward you greatly.
Will you help me with my research?
