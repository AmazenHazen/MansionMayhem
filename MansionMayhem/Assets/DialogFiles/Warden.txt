Ahhh a human! It is the first time we have had one of you for awhile!
I am a ghost, but I need your help before I can pass on to the next life.
I am the warden of this penitentiary but have lost control to the gang leader, DeathCrutch.

Will you assist me in defeating Deathcrutch.

Can you help me break out from my Demon Pact so I can return to my realm?
