Thank you for coming to my mansion and solving my riddles. I mean no harm.
Now that my riddles have been solved I can be free.
But first, let me return the favor.
Since you have solved my riddles I'll give you one to help your journey.

"The Dark Elemental is made of four."
"Fire, Bone, Blood, and Shadow."
"But he fears the light from lore."
"The Aether Light, the heaven's bow."

With that information I wish you best of luck on your journey.
Good Bye.
