Ahhh a human! It is the first time we have had one of you for awhile!
I am a ghost, but I need your help before I can pass on to the next life.
I am the warden of this penitentiary but have lost control to the gang leader, Death Clutch.
Will you assist me in defeating gang leader.

DeathCrutch has taken refuge in my office to the north of the prison block.
One of the prisoners stole my keys to my office, but I was able to escape with the keys to the prison block.
Here are the keys to enter the prison.
Good luck!
