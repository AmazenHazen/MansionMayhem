This is it! This is what I needed!
"August 26th, 2013 - There is no way out! That damn Warden and his guards have trapped me yet again in Purgatory!"
"One day I will move on in my life."
"September 13th, 2013 - I am Death Clutch! Leader of the Ghost Gang! The Warden should be bowing down to me!"
"October 3rd, 2013 - I have been contacted through the shadows, a Dark Elemental."
"He whispers to me that he knows a way out. I don't trust him."
"January 14th, 2014 - Giving in seems to be the only way."
"The Dark Elemental tells me that he will kill all of the guards with his beasts if I agree to his terms."
"I have to distract the halfling and the inventor, the ones that will be our downfall."
"And I will be stuck in Purgatory for the rest of my days."
Thank you for finding this, it is very enlightening.
